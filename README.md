The project contains an ASPNETCORE C# project that was deployed to Azure cloud platform using Github Actions.

The primary goal of the app was to display cars that the administrator logged as available on the lot for sale so that the users could buy them. 

The admin had special privileges to perform CRUD operations on the list of cars (which would in turn modify a locally stored database).
